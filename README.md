<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Problem
My company need a way to check if the interns we have are logging their times for the day on Toggl.

### Solution
I created a project that uses Toggl's api to allow me to check if the interns logged times for the day, week and month.
The project uses the Toggl workspace's Id and apikey to retreive the logged data.
There are only 5 users per workspace as it is on the free plan.
