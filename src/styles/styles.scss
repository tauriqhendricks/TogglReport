/*
  To use your variables in other components, you’ll have to import them into every component-name.component.scss file like so.
  But because we imported all of Bootstrap’s .scss files into our angular.json file, we can leave off the path which makes things much cleaner:
  component-name.component.scss 
  @import 'variables';
